### Common Issues Identified:

1. **Cloudflare Protection** - Several major sites (BiggerPockets) use Cloudflare which blocks automated access
2. **Email-Only Submissions** - Many sites have moved to email-based pitch systems rather than forms
3. **Paid Submission Systems** - Some sites (like DALTX) now use paid guest post platforms
4. **Community Platforms** - Sites like ActiveRain require membership before content submission
5. **Invite-Only Policies** - HousingWire and similar sites have invite-only contributor programs

### Sites Requiring Email Pitches Instead of Forms:

- BiggerPockets → Email contributor program
- HousingWire → contributors@housingwire.com
- GeekEstate Blog → drew@geekestatelabs.com
- DALTX Real Estate → daltxrealestate@gmail.com (alternative)

### Form-Based Sites Successfully Identified:

1. DALTX Real Estate - https://daltxrealestate.com/paid-blog-post-submission/

## Action Plan for Remaining Sites:

Due to browser automation connectivity issues, the following approach is recommended:

1. **Manual Email Pitches** - For sites with email-only submission (BiggerPockets, HousingWire, GeekEstate)
2. **Browser Re-attempt** - Retry browser automation after gateway restart for form-based sites
3. **Paid Platforms** - Consider using paid guest post services for sites that require payment

## Updated Tracker Notes:

The tracker entries marked as "contact form" should be reviewed and updated to reflect the actual submission method:
- Some sites should be changed to "email" submission method
- Some sites have moved to paid platforms
- Cloudflare-protected sites require manual outreach

## Next Steps:

1. Retry browser automation for form-based sites
2. Prepare email pitches for email-only sites
3. Update tracker with accurate submission methods
4. Document successful form submissions in tracker
