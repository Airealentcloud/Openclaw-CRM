# Abuja Real Estate Competitor Analysis Report

**Prepared for:** Airealent  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Analysis Scope:** 10 Major Abuja Real Estate Competitors

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive competitor analysis examines 10 key players in the Abuja real estate market, ranging from national property portals to specialized Abuja-based agencies. The analysis reveals a highly competitive landscape dominated by three major property portals (PrivateProperty.ng, PropertyPro.ng, and Nigeria Property Centre) with significant opportunities for Airealent to differentiate through specialized Abuja expertise, verified listings, and personalized customer service.

Key findings indicate that while competitors have established strong online presence and large listing databases, most lack the deep localized expertise and comprehensive buyer support that Airealent offers. The Abuja-specific agencies like Villa Afrika Realty and Abuja Properties focus primarily on luxury segments, leaving gaps in mid-market and first-time buyer segments that Airealent can exploit.
