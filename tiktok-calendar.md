# TikTok 28‑Day Plan (Based on 40 videos from @cokonjo)

**Observed patterns (from 40 videos):**
- Fast, punchy hooks; on‑screen text within the first second.
- Mix of **property tours**, **street/vox‑pop**, and **talking‑head** advice.
- Relatable, humorous moments (budget vs taste, agent POV).
- Uses local Abuja neighborhood names + price points to drive saves.
- Clear CTA: “DM/WhatsApp,” “Save this,” “Comment your budget.”
- Simple audio: soft Afrobeat or native voice; never drowns narration.
